<p class="nature">Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. 
With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, 
and go through an ontogenetic stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development.
